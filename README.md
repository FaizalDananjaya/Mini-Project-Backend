## 4. Approach & Design

### Initial Plan

I broke down the requirements into core components: file upload handling, asynchronous evaluation pipeline, AI-driven analysis using LLM chaining, and structured result reporting. Key assumptions included using Node.js for simplicity, mocking LLM responses for demo purposes, and in-memory storage for uploads/tasks to avoid database setup complexity. Scope boundaries focused on the specified API endpoints and evaluation parameters, without additional features like authentication or advanced UI.

### System & Database Design

The system uses a simple Express.js server with three main routes: /upload for file handling, /evaluate for starting async evaluation, and /result/{id} for retrieving results. No traditional database is used; instead, global Maps store uploads and tasks in memory for simplicity. For long-running tasks, a task queue is simulated with status tracking (queued → processing → completed/failed).

API Endpoints:

- POST /upload: Accepts multipart form data with 'cv' and 'project_report' files, parses content, returns upload ID
- POST /evaluate: Takes uploadId in body, starts background evaluation, returns task ID
- GET /result/{id}: Returns task status and final result when completed

### LLM Integration

I chose OpenAI's GPT-4 for its strong reasoning capabilities in text analysis and comparison tasks. For demo purposes, mock responses are used when API key is unavailable. Prompt design focuses on clear, structured instructions for extraction, comparison, and scoring. Chaining logic involves sequential calls: first extract CV data, then compare with job requirements, finally score the project report.

RAG strategy is mocked with predefined job description and scoring rubric stored in config files, retrieved based on context type (cv_scoring or project_scoring).

### Prompting Strategy

Examples of actual prompts:

- CV Extraction: "Extract structured info from CV: skills, experiences, projects. CV: [content]"
- CV Comparison: "Compare CV data with job requirements. Job: [context]. CV: [data]"
- Project Scoring: "Score project report based on rubric. Rubric: [rubric]. Project: [content]"

### Resilience & Error Handling

LLM API calls include try-catch with fallback to mock responses on failure. For async evaluation, errors are caught and task status set to 'failed' with error message. No advanced retry/backoff implemented due to time constraints, but structure allows for easy addition.

### Edge Cases Considered

- Invalid file types or missing files in upload
- Non-existent uploadId or taskId in evaluate/result
- LLM API timeouts or failures (handled with mocks)
- Large files (multer handles size limits)
- Concurrent requests (in-memory storage is not thread-safe, but sufficient for demo)

## 5. Results & Reflection

### Outcome

The implementation successfully provides the required API endpoints with async processing. File parsing works for text, PDF, and docx formats. The AI pipeline correctly chains LLM calls for evaluation, producing structured JSON results with match rates, feedback, and scores.

### Evaluation of Results

Mock responses provide consistent, reasonable outputs for demo. With real LLM, results would depend on prompt quality and model capabilities. The structured prompts ensure stable, relevant feedback.

### Future Improvements

With more time, I'd add a real vector database like ChromaDB for dynamic context retrieval, implement proper retry/backoff for API calls, add authentication and rate limiting, and create unit tests. Constraints included time (focused on core functionality), API limits (used mocks), and tools (stuck with Node.js stack).

## 6. Screenshots of Real Responses

### /evaluate Response

```
{
  "id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
  "status": "queued"
}
```

### /result/{id} Response

```
{
  "id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
  "status": "completed",
  "result": {
    "cv_match_rate": 0.82,
    "cv_feedback": "Strong in backend and cloud, limited AI integration experience.",
    "project_score": 7.5,
    "project_feedback": "Meets prompt chaining requirements, lacks error handling robustness.",
    "overall_summary": "Overall, this candidate has a 82% match on skills and experience, with a project score of 7.5/10. Solid fit but could use more AI experience."
  }
}
```

## 7. (Optional) Bonus Work

Added support for PDF and docx file parsing using pdf-parse and mammoth libraries. Implemented basic error handling for file upload and evaluation failures.
